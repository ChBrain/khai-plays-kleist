# CLAUDE.md, the Kleist house

This repository is a **khai plays house**: a production house dedicated to one
source, Heinrich von Kleist. It was raised by khai-stage (the impresario's
generator); the plays are written separately, in khai-playwright mode.

## What lives here

- `plays/` holds the productions: each play file plus the plots it chains and the
  elements those plots cast. This is the only content.
- The rest is the wiring and the gates, raised once and not improvised.

## The house is the Estate

`README.md` is this house's **Estate identity**: the production that answers for
the run. Every play logs the house in its `Estate` (E), and the conformance test
checks the link resolves. A play with no Estate is not yet a production.

## Branching

Computed, not chosen. Let the guard pick the lane:

```
npx khai-guard branch <topic>
```

- `play/<topic>` owns `plays/**` (the productions).
- `governance/<topic>` owns the gates and config (`.github/**`, `.husky/**`,
  `khai-guard.config.json`, `tests/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `REFERENCE.md`, `REFERENCES.md`, `management/**`).
- `changeset-release/*` is a bot-controlled general lane for version releases.

A **management order** (`management/orders/**`) is a **rider**: an order directs
work in any lane, so it rides the lane of the change it drives. Write the order
beside that change and the guard folds both onto one branch (an order that
restages a play lands as one `play/` PR); committed alone, an order homes to
`governance/`. So an order and the change it commands are one PR, never two.

Never `--no-verify`. Never merge; open the PR and stop.

## Versioning

We align version numbers using changesets under the following rules:

- **Adding a play** -> `minor` bump (so the minor version indicates the total count of plays).
- **Everything else** (governance, formatting, etc.) -> `patch` bump.

## Protection

Content is CC-BY-NC-SA, code is MIT (see `LICENSE` and `LICENSE-CODE`); the
source is credited where it is in the public domain, never claimed. `main` is
protected: pull requests and the gate checks are required before merge.
