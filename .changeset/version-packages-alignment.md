Governance: adopt the aligned Version-Packages flow. Upgrade the `changeset-check`
gate (exempt `changeset-release/*` and `dependabot/*`, pass `--branch`), bump
`@chbrain/khai-guard` to `^0.1.16`, prefix the `version` script with `npx`, and flip
the CLAUDE.md doctrine so a play add carries a `minor` changeset (steered through the
Version Packages PR; the reconcile keeps `minor = count` and the patch at 0). Ships
no package content: an empty changeset.
